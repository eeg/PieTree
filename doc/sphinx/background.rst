Purpose
=======

|PT| is a program for drawing pretty pictures of phylogenetic trees.
Its main purpose is displaying discrete character states, including ancestral state reconstructions.
It doesn't do any kind of analysis---it just produces images.
FIXME: for info on doing asr for pt input, see...

History
=======

The first incarnation of |PT| was written in C by Walter Brisken in 2007.
In  2008, I rewrote it all in Python (as an excuse to practice Python and learn about the Cairo graphics library) and gave it a more useable interface.
Features have been gradually accumulating since then.
